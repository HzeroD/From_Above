### Introduction

From Above is a choose your own adventure browser game built for General Assembly's SEI Unit 1 project. The minimum expectations are the following:
1. At least four alternative endings
2. Animations
3. Music
4. Good story

A cursory view might lead to the dismissal of this project's functionality as a little above easy, but the reality of its actual difficulty for a beginner programmer becomes clear from the outset. 

There is of course much writing and creativity involved in the crafting of a halfway decent story. A process which quickly increases in complexity due to the nature of the game and the minimum of four endings required.
    
The questions of which data structures were to be used to handle the numerous parts of the story are central. Lacking experience in classes and their behaviors the choice of array ended up being considered best. Arrays of objects(which in turn handled text) in particular.

Handling the functionality of story choices, their associated DOM manipulations and CSS hiccups(to not say disasters) made for a busy project week.


### Motivations

While the tasks at hand were time-consuming and challenging, the process was enjoyable throughout. Stories had always raptured me as a child, be it in the form of video games, movies, anime, books and my own occassional 2 hour flights of imagination. Choose your own adventure was a no-brainer.

The pragmatic reason was the need to improve my level of competence in CSS, which I figured this project choice would aid.
